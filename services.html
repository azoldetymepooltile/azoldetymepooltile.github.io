<h2>Services</h2>
<p>
    We use a commercial pressure washer with a magnesium sulfate, which is softer than the pool tile,
    eliminating any risk of damage. We then clean the debris out of your pool with our pump and
    filtration system. Any residue that remains will not harm your pool or equipment and your pool
    will be calcium free and ready to use within 24 hours of our service. <span class="emphasis">Call us for your free estimate</span>.
</p>

<h2>Why Our Technology is Better</h2>
<p>
    We clean the calcium, scaling, and hard water deposits from the pool tile quickly and efficiently
    using our ecologically safe and biodegradable pressure wash technology with Maxx Strip (Salt)
    which is softer than tile. This leaves the pool tile and your pool <span class="emphasis">"Like it did when it was NEW."</span>
